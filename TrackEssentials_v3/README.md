> # Legacy (v3) plug-in installer (64 bits)
> The Windows and macOS versions of the TrackEssentials and BusTools (v3) plug-ins are enjoying their well-deserved retirement after being in service for over a decade and are now made available as freeware. Use the links below to install these legacy plugins. Please note that these plugins come as VST (and AU) formats only. MacOS versions of these legacy plugins are for Intel processors only (or require Rosetta for Apple Silicon M1/M2 processors). The freeware offer does not apply to Android in-app versions. Please read the terms and conditions carefully prior to downloading or using these free plugins. Free plugins come without support or warranty.
